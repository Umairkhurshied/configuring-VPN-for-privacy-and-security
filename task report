To demonstrate the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and securing communication by setting up and testing a VPN connection.

Steps Performed:::

Selected a reputable free VPN provider (e.g., ProtonVPN).
Created a free account on the VPN provider’s website.
Downloaded and installed the VPN client.
Connected to a VPN server (nearest available location).
Checked the IP address before and after connection using whatismyipaddress.com.
Verified traffic encryption by browsing a secure website (https://example.com).

Disconnected the VPN and compared browsing speed and IP address.
Researched VPN encryption protocols (AES-256, OpenVPN, WireGuard) and their benefits.

Findings:::

IP address changed successfully after connecting to the VPN.
Traffic encryption confirmed through secure browsing tests.
Browsing speed reduced slightly due to encryption overhead.

Benefits of VPN:::

Encrypts internet traffic, protecting sensitive data.
Masks IP address, improving anonymity.
Helps bypass geo-restrictions.
Protects against data interception on public Wi-Fi.

Limitations of VPN:::

May reduce browsing speed.
Trust depends on VPN provider’s privacy policy.
Some websites block known VPN IPs.

Conclusion:::

VPNs are a vital tool for privacy protection and secure communication, especially on untrusted networks.
While they offer significant benefits, choosing a trustworthy provider and understanding their limitations is essential.

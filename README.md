# configuring-VPN-for-privacy-and-security
This task explored the role of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) in enhancing online privacy and ensuring secure communication. I began by selecting a reputable free VPN provider and creating an account. After downloading and installing the VPN client, I connected to a chosen server location, verifying the connection through a change in my public IP address using an online tool. To confirm that my traffic was encrypted, I visited various websites while connected to the VPN. I then disconnected and compared browsing speed and IP address with and without the VPN to assess its impact. Additional research was conducted on VPN encryption methods, privacy features, and common use cases. This exercise demonstrated how VPNs mask user identity, secure data transmission, and help bypass geo-restrictions, while also acknowledging potential limitations such as reduced speed and trust dependency on the VPN provider.
